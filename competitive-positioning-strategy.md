```

### FAQ Strategy (Address Nubway Weaknesses)
```
KEY FAQ TOPICS:
- "Why don't you hide your pricing like competitors?"
- "Can smaller practices afford professional equipment?"  
- "What if I need service on weekends or holidays?"
- "How is your support different from international companies?"
```

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Update device pricing strategy** - Show transparent starting prices
2. **Revise target market messaging** - Emphasize all practice sizes
3. **Strengthen local advantage** - Tel Aviv showroom, Hebrew support
4. **Create price comparison tools** - "Get quote in 2 minutes vs. 2 weeks"

### Content Updates:
1. **Hero section** - Lead with pricing transparency
2. **Device cards** - Show starting prices prominently  
3. **Why Choose Us** - Local vs. international positioning
4. **FAQ section** - Address hidden pricing concerns

## Success Metrics

This competitive positioning gives Davidov clear, defensible advantages while addressing real market gaps that Nubway and other competitors are leaving open.
